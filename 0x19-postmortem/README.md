 
Issue Summary:
- Duration: The outage lasted approximately 3 hours, from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM UTC.
- Impact: The outage affected our web application, resulting in a complete service disruption for all users. Approximately 90% of our user base experienced downtime, leading to frustration and potential loss of trust.
- Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which led to a traffic bottleneck and subsequent server overload.

Timeline:
- 10:00 AM UTC: Issue detected through a spike in error rates reported by our monitoring system.
- 10:10 AM UTC: Engineers began investigating potential causes, initially focusing on backend database issues.
- 10:30 AM UTC: Misleading assumption led to a deep dive into database performance, consuming valuable time.
- 11:00 AM UTC: After realizing the database was not the root cause, attention shifted to network and server configurations.
- 11:30 AM UTC: Incident escalated to senior engineers and management as downtime persisted.
- 12:00 PM UTC: Root cause identified as load balancer misconfiguration.
- 1:00 PM UTC: Service restored after load balancer settings were corrected.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was traced back to a misconfigured load balancer, which was directing an excessive amount of traffic to a single server instance. This led to server overload and subsequent downtime for the entire application.

To resolve the issue, engineers quickly reconfigured the load balancer to evenly distribute traffic across available server instances. Additionally, automated checks and alerts were implemented to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Improvements: 
  - Strengthen monitoring and alerting systems to detect load balancer misconfigurations promptly.
  - Implement regular load testing to ensure the system can handle peak traffic loads without issues.
  - Enhance documentation and training for engineers to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.

- Tasks:
  1. Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations.
  2. Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time insights into traffic distribution.
  3. Develop and implement automated load testing procedures.
  4. Provide additional training to engineering teams on load balancer management and troubleshooting.
  5. Schedule regular audits of critical system configurations to identify and rectify potential issues proactively.

By addressing these corrective measures and implementing preventative actions, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages in the future, ensuring a more stable and reliable service for our users.
